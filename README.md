# Angularjs-Quiz-App

Live : [Angular Quiz App](http://www.saurabhrana.com/angular "Quiz App")

Created a responsive quiz web  and used the data in the form of the JSON document and injected it into the view by using different services and directives of Angular on 3 different controllers that holds the Model and binds relevant information into the view.

## Things I'm proud of
- Single Page Application
- Search Functionality
- Smooth quiz taking experience.
